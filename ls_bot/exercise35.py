# Fix the following code so it properly calculates the average of two numbers provided by the user:

# num1 = input('Enter the first nubmer: ')
# num2 = input('Enter the second number: ')
# average = num1 + num2 / 2
# print(f'The average is {average}')

num1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))
num2 = float(input('Enter the second number: '))
average = (num1 + num2) / 2
print(f'The average is {average}')
