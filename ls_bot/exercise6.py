# Write a program that asks the user for their age and then prints a message telling them how old
# they will be in 10 years. 

age = input('Please provide your current age:')
print(f'In 10 years, you will be {int(age) + 10} years old.')

# age = 22
# print(f'in 10 years, you will be {age + 10} years old.')
# This was practice to see how applying 'int' to 'age + 10' handles user input.
