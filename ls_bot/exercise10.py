# What will happen when the following code is run? Why?

# print(greeting)
# greeting = 'Hello world!'

# Answer: Python will give an error stating 'greeting' is not defined. The code should be reversed
# with greeting defined first, and then print(greeting) after:

greeting = 'Hello world!'
print(greeting)
