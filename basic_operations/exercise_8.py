# To what value does the following expression evaluate?

# '12' < '9'

# Answer: It evaluates to True because equality comparisons with strings go from left to right
# on each side of the comparison operator. 1 < 9 and that's where Python would end. If '12' and '9' were
# not put in ' ' and were actual numbers/integers, it would evaluate to false because 12 is not less than 9.
