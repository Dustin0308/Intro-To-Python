# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal
# to the list's length? For example:

# foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# print(foo[3])             # Will this result in an error?

# Answer: Yes. The index 3 does not exist in the list. It starts at 0 and goes to 2 and is out
# of range.
 
# The actual error is called an IndexError.
