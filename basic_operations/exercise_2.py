# Use the REPL and the arithmetic operators to extract the individual digits of 4936.

# 1. Ones place is 6.
# 2. Tens place is 3.
# 3. Hundreds place is 9.
# 4. Thousands place is 4.

# Each digit may require multiple Python statements.

# Answer is done in REPL. Start with defining number = 4936
# ones = number % 10.
# send 'ones' to REPL and it will respond with 6. 
# number = number // 10
# tens = number % 10.
# send 'tens' to REPL and it will respond with 3.
# number = number // 10
# hundrens = number % 10.
# send 'hundreds' to REPL and it will respond with 9.
# thousands = number // 10.
# send 'thousands' to REPL and it will respond with 4.
