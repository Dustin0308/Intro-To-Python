# Assuming you have the following assignment:

# pi = 3.141592

# Write some code to convert the value of 'pi' to a string and assigns it to a variable named 
# 'str_pi'.

pi = 3.141592
str_pi = str(pi)
print(str_pi)                   # 3.141592
print(type(str_pi))             # <clas 'str'>. To prove it is successfully converted to a string.
