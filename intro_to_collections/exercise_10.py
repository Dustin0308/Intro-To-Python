# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code,
# can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = {'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl', 'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# Not neccesarily. Since sets are unordered and can't be indexed, the elements hold no particular
# order. Sets are also immutable so the elements within the set cannot be mutated.
