# Why can we treat strings as sequences?

# Since strings are ordered, you can access the individual characters (not objects) with indexing.
# Sequences are types that maintain an ordered collection of objects that can be indexed.
 
# Example below:

letters = 'abcdefg'
print(letters[2])                   # c
